# Alchemy Stars Terminal Simulator
## What is this?
This is something that was created to provide a close enough approximation to the actual terminal system from Alchemy Stars. This is the WebGL Release that is hosted on GitHub Pages

## Future Plans

While this release technically already displays all the conversation, some other features might be added, such as the following:
- Name the conversations so that users will have an idea of what the conversation is about (right now, only the "story id" is being displayed in the selection) *
- Make a better approximation about the fonts used. (Right now, I just used the default font from Unity's TextMeshPro)
- Format the conversations better (I'm bad making UI [If it wasn't evident enough XD])
- Add Support for other languages (While I think I can add them, I don't have the list of Aurorian names in different languages and so if I try it now, the dialogue language should be swappable but the names of the aurorians will stay in english.)
- Add the Colossus markers for conversations that jump over to the colossus (It is in the data. I just don't know the best way to display it)
- (I'm not sure if this actually exists) Add the ability to play voices from voiced lines. (The data seems to differentiate normal lines from "voice" lines but I also don't have the audio files for those so... no plans to do anything right now)
